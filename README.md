D&Dr (pronounced "d-'n-d-er") is a full stack Ruby on Rails application to help players of the popular Dungeons and Dragons game to organize campaigns, characters, and adventure chapters.

Although D&D has been around for decades, players mainly rely on a PDF form to create their characters. After each adventure chapter, they have to fill out a new form. If players want to share there character info with their teammates, they have to share the PDF via email or some other method.

Wouldn't it be so great if there was an app where you can create/share your "campaign" (a.k.a. your group's instance of a D&D game) and create/share your characters all in one spot? Well now there is with D&Dr!
